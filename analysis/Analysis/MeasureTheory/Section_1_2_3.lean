A companion to (the introduction to) Section 1.2.3 of the book "An introduction to Measure Theory".

/-- Proposition 1.2.18 -/
theorem LebesgueMeasurable.nonmeasurable : ∃ E : Set (EuclideanSpace' 1), E ⊆ Real.equiv_EuclideanSpace' '' (Set.Icc 0 1) ∧ ¬ LebesgueMeasurable E := by
  sorry

/-- Exercise 1.2.26 (Outer measure is not finitely additive)-/
example : ∃ E F : Set (EuclideanSpace' 1), E ∩ F = ∅ ∧ Bornology.IsBounded E ∧ Bornology.IsBounded F ∧ Lebesgue_outer_measure (E ∪ F) ≠ Lebesgue_outer_measure E + Lebesgue_outer_measure F := by
  sorry

/-- Exercise 1.2.27 (Projections of measurable sets need not be measurable) -/
example : ∃ E : Set (EuclideanSpace' 2), LebesgueMeasurable E ∧ ¬ LebesgueMeasurable ((fun x ↦ Real.equiv_EuclideanSpace' (x 0: ℝ)) '' E) := by sorry
