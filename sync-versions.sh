# This repository uses the library `SubVerso` to extract information
# from the code respository and use it in the website. SubVerso is
# compatible with every Lean release, allowing the book to use a
# different version than the Mathlib development. The versions of the
# library must match, however.
#
# The CI script '.github/workflows/check-version-consistency.yml' makes
# sure that the versions match. If they do not, this script can be used
# to fix the situation.
